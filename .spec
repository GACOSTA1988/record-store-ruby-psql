Record Store Continued

Follow along with last night's lessons and add CRUD functionality for Songs. Consider adding Song properties such as lyrics, songwriter and so on.

Once you've completed all CRUD, add integration testing to your application.
Feel free to style and continue building out the application to add any functionality that interests you.
